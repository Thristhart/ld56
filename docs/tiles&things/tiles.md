floor: this is normal ground you can walk on
bird
rat
turtle
frog

water: this is normalish ground you can only walk on if you can swim (the turtle can swim)
turtle

chasm: this is weird ground you can only fly over it, but you can't stand on it or walk on it
bird

tunnel: tight spot only the rat can pass through because it's small (can only exist if you can play a rat)
rat

fly tile: will eat/hurt anything unless cleared by a frog first
frog

wall: nobody can walk, fly, or stand on a wall!

goal zone: both animals go here and you win

gate: this is an entity that is placed on terrain that is normally impassable for some creatures, it might look different based on what terrain it's placed on. when "closed" it behaves as the tile it's placed on and when "open" it behaves as floor. it can be opened/closed by a button or a switch. over wall it forms a "gate" over chasm/water it forms a "drawbridge"

HOLY SHIT WHAT IF YOU CLOSE A GATE WHILE AN ANIMAL OR ROCK IS ON TOP OF IT?

button: this can trigger gates when there's something on it such as a critter or boulder. it will open the gates as long as there's something on it

switch: this can toggle gates when you bump into it

log - knock this down to make a bridge over water or chasm

boulder - you can push these around, if you push one into water it becomes floor. if you push one into a chasm it disappears
