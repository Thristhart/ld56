Recursive tiny creatures
    Let's say you're a frog, and then you eat a fly

Collecting tiny things

Combining tiny things

That little robot from Axiom Verge 2

The video game Creatures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_(video_game_series)

Just Sonic

you can only bring a courple of little guys into each sokoban level and the solution is different for each level depending on which little guys you bring in, maybe bring four


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Squares for movement 

the sokoban setting should be something very cosy like an outdoor garden :)

we should have a hunger clock that feels intense and high stakes
wildfire chasing you? 
various collectable items which interact with the clock, potentially delaying it

start with one little guy
making it through a level will get you a choice of 3 little creatures 
little creatures are both increased game mechanics and act as life hearts
when you get caught by fire before clearing the level the creature will 'leave you' because of poor leadership

turtle
- go from water to land
- can swim X squares
- knock down a tree?

mouse
- go through small spaces
- dig?
- chew through straw/rope/obstacles

birb
- fly over X spaces //CD
- cannot walk on land
- cannot land on water

frog
- terrains - water/land
- can swim X squares
- jump over one square  //CD

fish
- swim X spaces
- cannot go on land

Oh good we have terrain types.
- water
- land
- trees
- void/cracks in ground
- mouse hole space (idk branches or something? a log?)

So, mvp style: there's a guy who can walk to adjacent spaces and push things in those spaces, and there's a guy who can hop over spaces (every move is 2 in a direction) and stomp to push all items out from them?

Okay, so, Turtle and Rat are running from Wild Fire. Bird and Frog(Not sure about Frog?) are running from wild firearms. Then they meet and run from both.
